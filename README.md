# HTML, CSS, and Git: Horiseon Website Code Refactor

## Description

The goal of this assignment was to increase accessibility of the Horiseon website source code. This was done in several ways, outlined below:

- Adding a meaningful title to concisely describe content of the page.
- Replacing nonsemantic `div` elements with semantic elements such as `header`, `nav`. `main`, `section`, `aside`, `section` and `footer`. Semantic elements improve readability of the code as they structure the content of the codeblock within.
- Adding `alt` attributes to `img` elements. `alt` attributes improve accessibility of code by describing the content of the image. This is useful for screen readers to describe the content of images to visually-impaired users. It is also useful in the case that the image does not load.
- Adding `id` attribute to fix link by directing it to appropriate section on the page.
- Changing order of CSS rulesets to reflect structure of semantic HTML elements.
- Adding comments to CSS Stylesheet to reflect the change made to the HTML code.

Below are the **User Story** and **Acceptance Criteria** associated with this assignment.
